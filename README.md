======================

Quickly get a feel for some postgres table.

Use if you're looking at a yet unfamiliar database and want to know what's actually inside.

For each column in the specified table the script shows its most frequently used values
as well as the smallest and largest value.

Work in progress. Next steps:

- [ ] implement command-line options for daily use. 
      Right now the database/schema/table is hardcoded.
